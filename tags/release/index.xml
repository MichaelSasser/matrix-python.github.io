Now a new event is coming up. The release of Python 3.10.0.
Some new and interesting features, like the replacement of typing.Union with the overload operator | and Explicit Type Aliases are introduced into the programming language. And then there is Structural Pattern Matching.
Structural Pattern Matching Even before that, controversial features, such as PEP 484 &amp;ndash; Type Hints, were added to Python.</description></item></channel></rss>
