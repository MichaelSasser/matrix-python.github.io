The room identifier was Python3:matrix.org, since #python:matrix.org was still used by the &amp;ldquo;old Python&amp;rdquo; room, which was abandoned by the administrator and bombarded with spam messages.
A few hours later the spammers joined from the old room started their attack on our new room.</description></item></channel></rss>
