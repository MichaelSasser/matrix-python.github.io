We have just celebrated the 30th birthday of CPython, which was released on
February 20, 1991, in version 0.9.0[^first-release]. Now a new event is coming
up. The release of Python 3.10.0.

Some new and interesting features, like the replacement of `typing.Union` with
the overload operator `|` and _Explicit Type Aliases_ are introduced into the
programming language. And then there is _Structural Pattern Matching_.

## Structural Pattern Matching

Even before that, controversial features, such as
[PEP 484 -- Type Hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/), were added
to Python. Some programmers are still not happy _Type Hints_. A part of them
come to terms with it, others, including myself, appreciate the feature. But
now a new feature comes along. _Structural Pattern Matching_ -- a "not that
pythonic" version of `if`/`else`, Guido never wanted to add to the Python
programming language, or like `C` programmers would call it: "The Python
version of the `switch`/`case` statement".

### Example

```python
def http_error(status):
  match status:
    case 400:
      return "Bad request"
    case 404:
      return "Not found"
    case 418:
      return "I'm a teapot"
```

However, leaving aside _The Zen of Python_[^zen-of-python] the feature could
still be useful. Unfortunately, I have a hard time with that. The words of Tim
Peters are more than a few tips and rules for me. I associate with them more an
attitude to life (and some well-thought-out programming rules).

It remains to be seen whether the feature will catch on. I assume that it will
behave like _Type Hints_ and it will first take a while until it catches on.
However, for developers who have not been programming for quite so long, this
should be much faster.
