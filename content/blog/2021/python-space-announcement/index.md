We are happy to announce the new _Python Space_:

<center>
{{< matrix identifier="#python-space:matrix.org" >}} 
</center>

This new Space includes our community Space:

<center>
{{< matrix identifier="#python-community:matrix.org" >}}
</center>
And rooms recommended by the communities:

| Room                                                 | Description                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| {{< matrix identifier="#python_typing:gitter.im" >}} | PEP 484, mypy, typeshed, pytype, pyre and typing in PyCharm |
| {{< matrix identifier="#python:nixos.org " >}}       | Anything regarding using Python with Nix.                   |

We are happy to add your favorite Python rooms to this Space, too. If you have
recommendations, feel free to join our _Meta room_
{{< matrix identifier="#python-meta:matrix.org" >}} and let us know about it.

As with our _Python Community Space_ -- this Space is optional -- there will be
no changes to our other rooms and you can carry on using it as you always have.
