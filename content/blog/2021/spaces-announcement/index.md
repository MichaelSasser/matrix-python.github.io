<!-- conversation is fun -- and it builds a stronger community. -->

So, as Spaces have made it out of labs, and we want to increase the community
feeling, we decided to give it a go -- so **we are excited to announce our new
Python community Space:** <br /><br />

<center>
{{< matrix identifier="#python-community:matrix.org" >}}
</center>
<br /><br />
In the Space you will find two new rooms in addition to our Python room:

| Name              | Room                                                     | Description                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Python** room   | {{< matrix identifier="#python:matrix.org" >}}           | For everything Python         |
| **Meta** room     | {{< matrix identifier="#python-meta:matrix.org" >}}      | For suggestions and proposals |
| **Offtopic** room | {{< matrix identifier="#python-off-topic:matrix.org" >}} | For everything off-topic      |

The [rules of the Python room]({{< ref "code_of_conduct" >}}) apply to this
rooms as well, except the "no-off-topic" rule for the Offtopic room, of course
ðŸ˜œ.

The Space is optional - there will be no changes to this room and you can carry
on using it as you always have. But we hope you'll join us :)
