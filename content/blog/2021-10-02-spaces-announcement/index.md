As we grow, we want to provide space for more conversations. Keeping
discussion on-topic in this room is the right thing to do, but off-topic
conversation is fun - and it builds a stronger community.

So, as Spaces have made it out of labs, and we want to increase the community
feeling, we decided to give it a go - so **we are excited to announce our new Python community Space:**

{{< matrix identifier="#python-community:matrix.org" >}}

In the Space you will find two new rooms:

- **Meta** room -- for suggestions and proposals:
  {{< matrix identifier="#python-meta:matrix.org" >}}
  _The rules of the Python room apply to this room as well._
- **Offtopic** room -- for everything off-topic:
  {{< matrix identifier="#python-off-topic:matrix.org" >}}
  _The rules of the Python room apply to this room as well, except the
  "no-off-topic" rule, of course ðŸ˜œ_

{{< img src="spaces.jpeg" alt="spaces image" caption="<center><em>The Python Community Space on Matrix</em></center>" class="border-0" >}}

The Space is optional - there will be no changes to this room and you can
carry on using it as you always have. But we hope you'll join us :)

PS: It seems, users have problems joining the space from element on Android. Please try to use the web or desktop client.
