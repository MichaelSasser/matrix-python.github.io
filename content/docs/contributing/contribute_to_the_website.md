## Create an issue

- [Bug report](https://github.com/matrix-python/matrix-python.github.io/issues/new?template=bug-report---.md)
- [Feature request](https://github.com/matrix-python/matrix-python.github.io/issues/new?template=feature-request---.md)

## Contribute to the website

You will find the code of this website on GitHub:

{{< alert icon="GitHub" text="<a href=\"https://github.com/matrix-python/matrix-python.github.io\">https://github.com/matrix-python/matrix-python.github.io</a>" />}}

The repository has two branches with infinite lifetime:

- The [master](https://github.com/matrix-python/matrix-python.github.io/tree/master) branch is
  protected and it gets updated on every release.
- The [develop](https://github.com/matrix-python/matrix-python.github.io/tree/develop) branch is
  the default/merging branch.

When you are working with the repo make sure to follow the
[GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and the
[Conventional Commits Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

The website is statically generated by
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions),
after merging a pull-request into the `master` branch.

It is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and based on the lovely template
[Doks](https://getdoks.org/), by
[Henk "h-enk" Verlinde](https://github.com/h-enk). You will find everything
you need in the
[documentation](https://getdoks.org/docs/prologue/introduction/) of the Doks
template.

## Improve our documentation

You will find our documentation in
[`./content/docs/`](https://github.com/matrix-python/matrix-python.github.io/tree/master/content/docs)
of our repository.
