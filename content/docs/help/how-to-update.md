If you are using the `element-web` on `https://app.element.io/` or any web
based version of Element, you are good to go. You don't need to update
anything manually. When there is a new version available, Element will notify
you. Then you have get the option to switch to the new one.

If you are using `element-desktop` (The desktop version), you may have to
update Element on your own.

To do that, use the App-Store, you installed Element with.
