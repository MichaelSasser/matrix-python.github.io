## Unable to join the community Space?

You can only join the Space with a compatible client and homeserver.
Since Spaces are a brand-new feature, only the newest versions of the Element
client are supporting them. Same with the homeservers Synapse and Dendrite.

If you are using older versions or different clients, you are currently not able
to join the Space. Nevertheless, you can join the rooms manually. You will
find the room IDs in [Quick Start â†’]({{< ref "quick-start" >}})
