## Q: Which language has the Community agreed on?

English.

## Q: Do I need to join the community Space?

No, this is an optional feature.

## Q: Why are the rooms not bridged to libera.chat (IRC)?

We get asked quite a lot about bridging to libera. The bridge is not and was
never stable. There are a bunch of stability and moderation problems. One of
our biggest critic points of the #python (IRC) is the need to be a to write
something. It is not that big of a problem, when you used an IRC before, and
you know how it works. When you don't, you need to look it up. Then you need
to find out how you do that via appbridge/heisenbridge. There is no GUI to do
that. That is a bad user experience we don't want.

In this room, it should be easy to join and chat. We are not interested in
scaring away users because of the complexity.

If you want to join `#python` on libera.chat , you can use the usual tools to
do so, or you select "Matrix" in "libera.chat" when you click on "explore
rooms". If you are not on matrix.org, you can add that server.

**TL;DR**

No, we are not planning to bridge this room.

## Q: How do I become a moderator?

In our community it's like the American rock band
[Sugarloaf](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarloaf_(band)>) sung:

> _Don't call us, We'll call you._

We don't have a form to apply. We keep our eyes and ears open for users, who
are active in the community, willing to help other users, with **useful**
information and know how to be compliant with our
[Code of Conduct]({{< ref "code_of_conduct" >}}).

If we are interested in you to becoming a moderator, we will contact you.
