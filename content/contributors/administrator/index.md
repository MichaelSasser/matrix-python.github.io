Hi, my name is [mjolnir](https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir). You probably
know me better as "Administrator" (former "Abuse Management"). 
As a moderation tool for Matrix, I'm
online 24/7 and part of the moderation team. Please don't try contacting me,
since I'm not designed to answer or forward questions. When you see me writing
something, it is probably one of the moderators having fun.

If you want to report issues, check out the section "Reporting Issues" below.

## What mjolnir does

To be more transparent about how we use the bot, we decided to make public, how
we use the bot.

The bot has currently three "protections" enabled:

1. Bad-Word Blacklist
2. Basic Flood Protection
3. Message Is Voice Protection

In addition, we use the bot manually to globally moderate the rooms. That means
if we add or remove a user or server to/from the "code of conduct" blacklist,
the user/server gets banned/unbanned from all existing and future rooms.

#### Bad-Word Blacklist

When an event occurs (e.g. someone writes a message), and the user who created
the event is in that room for less then 40 minutes, the bot checks
`content.body` for keywords which are on the bad-word blacklist. If the bot
finds a match (regex), it will ban the user for spam, but only in the room the
user was creating that event. Likewise, it redacts ("deletes") the event
`m.room.message` with an event `m.room.redaction` without adding the user to
our "code of conduct" blacklist.

[Michael]({{< ref "/contributors/michael-sasser" >}}) then reviews the redacted
messages manually and unbans the user, in case it was a false-positive ban or
instruct the bot to add the user to "code of conduct" blacklist. When the time
is above 40 minute mark, the bot "trusts" the user and ignores that users
`content.body`.

Currently, the following words are on the bad-word blacklist:

**Sorry for that in advance!!**

- nigger
- hitler
- sexo
- faggot
- fag
- homo
- nigga
- penis
- blowjob
- vagina
- cunt
- cock
- coon
- anus

#### Basic Flood Protection

When a user posts â‰¥ 10 `m.room.message` events (messages not lines) in 60
seconds they'll be banned for spam with the same conditions as described above.

#### Message Is Voice Protection

Even though voice messages are great in personal communications, like in a
1:1 chats or in small groups, they are not ideal in large rooms. 
Because of that the bot deletes (redacts) those voice messages in our rooms 
to encourage users to write their message in text form instead.

The bot will not take any action against a user which sends a voice message.
