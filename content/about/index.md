## How everything started

Like every good story, at least on Matrix, ours starts with an `m.room.create` event,
when the Python room was created on Thu, Dec 31 2020 00:00:23 (UTC) by
[Michael]({{< ref "contributors/michael-sasser" >}}). <br />
The room identifier was `Python3:matrix.org`, since `#python:matrix.org` was
still used by the "old Python" room, which was abandoned by the administrator 
and bombarded with spam messages.

A few hours later the spammers joined from the old room started their attack 
on our new room. To support our project 
[ilex]({{< ref "contributors/ilex" >}}) joined the moderation team.

**Sat, Jan 04 2021 (UTC)** -- our Code of Conduct was created. Just a few days later 
[BrenBarn]({{< ref "contributors/brenbarn" >}}) joined the moderation team.

**Thu, Jan 28 2021 (UTC)** -- 
[James Belchamber]({{< ref "contributors/james-belchamber" >}})
wrote an email to the matrix team, to urge them, to clean up the old room from 
spam. Instead they "tombstoned" the old room into ours and assigned us the 
room identifier `#python:matrix.org`.
On the same day James joined the moderation team.

**Fri, Apr 30 2021 05:44 (UTC)** -- The 
[Abuse Management]({{< ref "contributors/abuse-management" >}}) bot was
deployed to the server. After a few days of intense testing, the bot joined
the Python room and started protecting the users from spam.
Since then the bot watches our rooms room 24/7.

**Wed, Sep 29 2021 20:01 (UTC)** -- We changed the main address of the Python 
room to `#python:matrix.org`

**Fri, Oct 08 2021 12:48 (UTC)** -- We announced our community Space and two new
rooms:
- **Meta** room -- for organizational questions, suggestions & proposals: 
  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#python-meta:matrix.org" target="_blank">
  `#python-meta:matrix.org`
  </a>
- **Offtopic** room -- for everything off-topic:
  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#python-off-topic:matrix.org" target="_blank">
  `#python-off-topic:matrix.org`
  </a>
