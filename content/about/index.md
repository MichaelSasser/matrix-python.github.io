## How Everything Started

#### 🗓️ Dec, 31 2020

Like every good story, at least on Matrix, ours starts with an `m.room.create` event,
when the Python room was created on Thu, Dec 31 2020 00:00:23 (UTC) by
[Michael]({{< ref "contributors/michael-sasser" >}}). <br />
The room identifier was `Python3:matrix.org`, since `#python:matrix.org` was
still used by the "old Python" room, which was abandoned by the administrator
and bombarded with spam messages.

A few hours later the spammers joined from the old room started their attack
on our new room. To support our project
[ilex]({{< ref "contributors/ilex" >}}) joined the moderation team.

#### 🗓️ Jan, 04 2021

Our Code of Conduct was created. Just a few days later
[BrenBarn]({{< ref "contributors/brenbarn" >}}) joined the moderation team.

#### 🗓️ Jan, 28 2021

[James Belchamber]({{< ref "contributors/james-belchamber" >}})
wrote an email to the matrix team, to urge them, to clean up the old room from
spam. Instead they "tombstoned" the old room into ours and assigned us the
room identifier `#python:matrix.org`.
On the same day James joined the moderation team.

#### 🗓️ Apr, 30 2021

The
[Abuse Management]({{< ref "contributors/abuse-management" >}}) bot was
deployed to the server. After a few days of intense testing, the bot joined
the Python room and started protecting the users from spam.
Since then the bot watches our rooms room 24/7.

#### 🗓️ Sep, 29 2021

We changed the main address of the Python
room to `#python:matrix.org`

#### 🗓️ Oct, 08 2021

We announced our community Space and two new
rooms:

- **Meta** room -- for organizational questions, suggestions & proposals:
  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#python-meta:matrix.org" target="_blank">
  `#python-meta:matrix.org`
  </a>
- **Offtopic** room -- for everything off-topic:
  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#python-off-topic:matrix.org" target="_blank">
  `#python-off-topic:matrix.org`
  </a>
