## The Python Community "Changelog"

### 🗓️ Dec, 31 2020

Like every good story, at least on Matrix, ours starts with an `m.room.create`
event, when the Python room was created on Thu, Dec 31 2020 00:00:23 (UTC) by
[Michael]({{< ref "contributors/michael-sasser" >}}). <br /> The room
identifier was `Python3:matrix.org`, since `#python:matrix.org` was still used
by the "old Python" room, which was abandoned by the administrator and
bombarded with spam messages.

A few hours later the spammers joined from the old room started their attack on
our new room. To support our project [ilex]({{< ref "contributors/ilex" >}})
joined the moderation team.

### 🗓️ Jan, 04 2021

Our Code of Conduct was created. Just a few days later
[BrenBarn]({{< ref "contributors/brenbarn" >}}) joined the moderation team.

### 🗓️ Jan, 28 2021

[James Belchamber]({{< ref "contributors/james-belchamber" >}}) wrote an email
to the matrix team, to urge them, to clean up the old room from spam. Instead
they "tombstoned" the old room into ours and assigned us the room identifier
`#python:matrix.org`. On the same day James joined the moderation team.

### 🗓️ Apr, 30 2021

The [Abuse Management]({{< ref "contributors/abuse-management" >}}) bot was
deployed to the server. After a few days of intense testing, the bot joined the
Python room and started protecting the users from spam. Since then the bot
watches our rooms room 24/7.

### 🗓️ Sep, 29 2021

We changed the main address of the Python room to `#python:matrix.org`

### 🗓️ Sep, 30 2021

[Michael]({{< ref "contributors/michael-sasser" >}}) started the development of
this website. His idea was, to create a simple "entrypoint" for new Members of
the community and a notice board for those, whom might be interested joining
us. <br /><br /> The _initial commit_ was on Oct, 10 2021. <br /> The release
and announcement was on XXX. {{< todo >}}
