Maintained by the non-profit Matrix.org Foundation, they aim to create an open platform which is as independent, vibrant and evolving as the Web itself&amp;hellip; but for communication.
As of June 2019, Matrix is out of beta, and the protocol is fully suitable for production usage.
Since then, Matrix evolved quite a bit, with plenty of features suitable for building a large community like ours.</description></item><item><title>Quick Start</title><link>https://matrix-python.github.io/docs/prologue/quick-start/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 13:59:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://matrix-python.github.io/docs/prologue/quick-start/</guid><description>ðŸ’¡ Information You are new to Matrix or Element or you want to know more about the features?
