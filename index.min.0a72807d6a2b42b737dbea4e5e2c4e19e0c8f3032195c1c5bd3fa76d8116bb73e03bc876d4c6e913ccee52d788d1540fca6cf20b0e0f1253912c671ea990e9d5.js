If you have many lines of code, the code block becomes collapsed down to 15 lines and is scrollable and expandable. Let everyone know what message you are referring to with message reply\u0026rsquo;s or just use the users nickname as reference. Communicate with other users in private Use $ \\textbf{\\LaTeX} $ math to get textbook like math Send images or videos Add non-disturbing Emoji reactions to messages Avatars help you recognize other users Work with the client on the operating system you prefer(even on the Nintendo 3DS if you like 😁) Quote or forward messages \u0026hellip; and many more features  Our community does not focus on specific features of the Python language or ecosystem. We like to provide simple access for discussions and immediate help with programming questions. In addition, we provide a platform for suggestions and proposals, as well as off-topic conversations.\nBefore you can start, make sure you have read our Code of Conduct.\nQuick Start # You are already on Matrix and you want to start quick?

Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.\nThis applies to communication in any room of the Python community Matrix Space   \u0026nbsp;#python-community:matrix.org   and commits and comments relating to any project in the matrix-python GitHub space.\nOur open source community strives to:\n Be friendly and patient. Be welcoming: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability. Be considerate: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we\u0026rsquo;re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else\u0026rsquo;s primary language. Be respectful: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Be careful in the words that we choose: Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour aren\u0026rsquo;t acceptable. Try to understand why we disagree: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong . Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.  Definitions # Harassment includes, but is not limited to:\n Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, age, regional discrimination, political or religious affiliation Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment Deliberate misgendering.

The --- delimiters signal Hugo that this is a front matter in the YAML format. Here is a generated example, how the front matter might look like: --- title: "My Title" description: "A description of the page content" lead: "A description of the page content" date: 2021-10-08T14:48:42+01:00 lastmod: 2021-10-08T14:48:42+01:00 draft: false images: ["avatar.svg" "foo.svg" "bar.svg"] menu: [...] # see below weight: 50 toc: false ---  For an documentation page the menu structure is:\nmenu:docs:parent:\u0026#34;\u0026lt;the parent\u0026gt;\u0026#34;# e.g. \u0026#34;prologue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tutorial\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;contributing\u0026#34;, ...By convention, \u0026lt;the parent\u0026gt; is the directory name of the last directory in the directory path the file is created in, if the path was not inside a page-bundle. This is because of our directory structuring convention. If this doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, the directory structure is wrong and must be corrected. Either in the directory structure or in the config/_default/menus.toml.\nTo follow our convention we go on with weights. The weight sets the order, the docs are shown to the user. You find our order (weight) convention in config/_default/menus.toml For example the Tutorial has the weight = 20 in the config/_default/menus.toml, so the weight of the tutorial starts with 2 (ignore the 0 in 20, we are only interested in the 2). Then the first entry will get the weight = 200. The one after that will get weight = 210, then weight = 220 and so on.\nThe Contributors #    Directory Description     ./content/contributors/ The base directory of the contributors    A Contributor page is the personal page every contributor has. The table of contributors is generated from that page. Make sure to create your page, when you contribute to the website.\nIn addition, the contributor page is needed in the header of the blog entry to show the reader more about the person who wrote the blog entry.\n  Spaces Announcement 🎉  Our community has grown to over 3500 members, and we are grateful for everyone who is bearing with us. Thanks Pythoneers!\nAs we grow, we want to provide space for more conversations.

To add the contributors to the blog entry the contributors variable is used. In this case, it was: contributors: [\u0026quot;Michael Sasser\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;BrenBarn\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ilex\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;James Belchamber\u0026quot;]\nIf you click on one of the contributors, marked with a red underline, you will see the contributor page of this user. For example, Michael\u0026rsquo;s contributor page is located in ./content/contributors/michael-sasser/. It contains a file _index.md and a file michael_sasser_ava.svg:\n _index.md is the file, which contains all text and references the image used. michael_sasser_ava.svg is the image used in the contributor page. Please remember our image conventions. The filename convention in those images is my_user_ava.extention.  You can create a template, which you can use for your contributor page by running this command:\n$ npm run create contributors/my-username/_index.md\nThe Contributor Front Matter Every Markdown file contains a header section, called front matter, in the YAML format to configure parts of the page or website.

To be able to use shortcodes, you must know, how they work. They are more or less like typical Python functions. They can use global or local variables and take any amount of named or anonymous arguments.\nDepending on how they are called, they might work differently.\nSome of the shortcodes, we use came with Hugo, a few came with the template and others are created by us.\nOur shortcodes are located as HTML files in layouts/shortcodes/. The name of the HTML file sets the name of the shortcodes.\nIf you find a shortcode used in on page, you can copy/paste and adjust it to your need.\nImages # img is defined in the Template.\nimg-simple is defined in the Template.\nIt is possible to use the file formats jpeg, png, tiff, bmp, gif and svg. Images are lazyloaded, blurred up, and responsive. They need to be place in a page bundle, for example, like this site:\n# tree of ./content/docs/contributing/ ... ├── contributing/ │ ├── contribute_to_the_website/ │ │ ├── index.md │ │ └── blog_card.jpeg │ └── _index.md └── _index.md Then you can use it with the shortcode in the Markdown file:\n Use {{\u0026lt; img-simple src=\u0026quot;my_image.jpeg\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;my image\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;border-0\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} for images smaller than 300 px, if they don\u0026rsquo;t need a figure and caption Use {{\u0026lt; img src=\u0026quot;my_image.jpeg\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;my image\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;border-0\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} for images larger than 300 px, if they don\u0026rsquo;t need a figure and caption Use {{\u0026lt; img src=\u0026quot;my_image.jpeg\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;my image\u0026quot; caption=\u0026quot;\u0026lt;center\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;My Caption\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/center\u0026gt;\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;border-0\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} for image larger than 300 px, or if they need a figure and caption.

For example: images: [\u0026quot;foo.svg\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;bar.jpeg\u0026quot;]\nImage Conventions # Our convention is to use a svg image whenever possible. If this is not possible, you use a png image, if your image contains an alpha channel. If not use an jpeg image or an gif, if your image only references a low number of colors. Other formats are only accepted if they are used for a special purpose.\nLinks and Cross References # ref is defined by Hugo.\nrelref is defined by Hugo.\nThe ref and relref shortcodes can be used to create permalinks, to a document using a relative or absolute path.\n{{\u0026lt; ref \u0026#34;/blog/my-post.md\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; relref \u0026#34;contributing\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} You can use the shortcode in Markdown:\n[shortcodes]({{\u0026lt; ref \u0026#34;shortcodes\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}) [Image Conventions]({{\u0026lt; ref \u0026#34;shortcodes\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}#image-conventions) or HTML:\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{\u0026lt; ref \u0026#34;shortcodes\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}\u0026#34;Shortcodes\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{\u0026lt; ref \u0026#34;shortcodes\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}#image-conventions\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Image Conventions\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; HTML links are normally only used in HTML documents or nested shortcodes, like the following warning, where you can\u0026rsquo;t use Markdown.\n{{\u0026lt; warning \u0026gt;}} A link inside a warning: \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{\u0026lt; ref \u0026#34;workflow\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Workflow\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;. {{\u0026lt; /warning \u0026gt;}} Rendered  ⚠️ Warning A link inside a warning: Workflow.

If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.   Which language has the Community agreed on?  English.  Do I need to join the community Space?  No, this is an optional feature.  Are the rooms bridged to ...?  No, and we are not planning to bridge this rooms.\nFor more information see Why are the rooms not bridged to libera.chat (IRC)? →  Why are the rooms not bridged to libera.chat (IRC)?  The bridge is not and was never stable. There are a bunch of stability and moderation problems. One of our biggest critic points of the #python (IRC) is the need to be registered on libera to participate. It is not that big of a difficulty, when you used an IRC before, and you know how it works. Otherwise, you need to look it up. Then you need to find out how to you do that via the appbridge/heisenbridge. There is no GUI to do that. That is a bad user experience we don\u0026rsquo;t want.\nIn this community, it should be easy to join and chat. We are not interested in scaring away users because of complexity bridging with it. If you want to join #python on libera.chat , you can use the usual tools to do so, or you select \u0026ldquo;Matrix\u0026rdquo; in \u0026ldquo;libera.chat\u0026rdquo; when you click on \u0026ldquo;explore rooms\u0026rdquo;. If you are not on matrix.org, you can add that server.\nTL;DR\nWe are not planning to bridge this rooms.\n  What is a moderator?
